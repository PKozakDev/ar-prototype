# ar-prototype
A simple implementation of Vuforia AR in Unity written in C#.

A single scene app that displays a few 3D models on a target picture. 

It's an early prototype to app 'ARpoly'.

Unity version 2019.1.7f1 with everything (including Vuforia) up to date as of 24.7.2019

To use this, download the repo and open it in Unity. You'll need a Vuforia license. In Unity, navigate to Resources/VuforiaConfiguration and input it in the appropriate field in the Inspector window. Free license is fine.

You can use this for whatever you like, but if you do, please change the target picture to something else.
